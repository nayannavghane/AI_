                <h2>What is AI?</h2>
                <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines and software that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. This includes things like learning, problem-solving, understanding language, and recognizing patterns. Think of it as teaching computers to think and learn.</p>
                <p><strong>How does it work?</strong> AI systems are trained on massive amounts of data. They use complex algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that data. The more data an AI has, the better it gets at its task.</p>
